# IDL Sentinel

IDL Sentinel is a self-hostable Next.js app for watching Solana program IDLs.
It fetches on-chain IDLs on a schedule, stores versioned snapshots, classifies
structural changes, and sends alerts to users who watch the affected programs.
An IDL, or Interface Definition Language, describes a program's public interface:
the instructions clients can call, the accounts they pass, the custom types they
decode, and the errors they may receive.

Use it when you depend on Solana programs and want to know when their public API
surface changes: instructions, account layouts, custom types, errors, or the IDL
itself.

IDL Sentinel is useful for protocol teams, integrators, wallet and indexer
developers, auditors, and anyone else who wants a warning when a program's
published interface changes.

## What It Does

- Monitors Anchor legacy IDL accounts and Solana Program Metadata IDL entries.
- Stores every new IDL snapshot in Supabase.
- Compares snapshots and records low, medium, high, or critical changes.
- Alerts only users who have the changed program in their watchlist.
- Supports Slack incoming webhooks and Telegram bot notifications.
- Lets admins add programs directly.
- Lets regular users activate a new shared program by paying a one-time USDC fee.

## How It Works

1. A program is added to `monitored_programs`.
2. IDL Sentinel fetches its current on-chain IDL and stores the first snapshot.
3. A cron job calls `/api/cron/monitor-idls`, usually every 15 minutes.
4. The monitor fetches each active program IDL and hashes the normalized JSON.
5. When the hash changes, IDL Sentinel creates a new snapshot and records the diff.
6. Slack and Telegram notifications are sent to users watching that program.

IDL Sentinel can only monitor programs with a discoverable on-chain IDL. Programs
without an Anchor or Program Metadata IDL cannot be activated until they publish
one.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or newer
- pnpm
- A Supabase project
- A Solana wallet for signing in
- A reliable Solana mainnet RPC URL for production monitoring

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd idl-sentinel
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local`.

Minimum required for the app to boot and authenticate:

| Variable                        | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Supabase project URL                                         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key used by browser/API RLS flows              |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Server-side key for cron, monitoring, and system writes      |
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL`                | Server-side RPC used by IDL fetches and payment verification |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL`    | Browser RPC used by wallet/payment flows                     |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK`    | `mainnet-beta`, `devnet`, or `testnet`                       |
| `JWT_SECRET`                    | Secret for signed wallet sessions                            |
| `CRON_SECRET`                   | Bearer token required by the monitoring endpoint             |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`           | Public app URL, for example `http://localhost:3000` locally  |

Generate secrets with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Required for non-admin program activation payments:

| Variable                        | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROGRAM_ACTIVATION_FEE_USDC`   | One-time fee regular users pay to add a new shared program    |
| `SOLANA_USDC_MINT`              | USDC mint address, defaults to mainnet USDC in `.env.example` |
| `PAYMENT_TREASURY_WALLET`       | Wallet that owns the treasury USDC account                    |
| `PAYMENT_TREASURY_USDC_ACCOUNT` | Destination associated token account for USDC payments        |

Required for Telegram notifications:

| Variable                | Purpose                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`    | Bot token from BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` | Bot username without `@` |

Slack does not require a global app secret. Each user stores their own Slack
incoming webhook URL in Settings.

### 3. Create the Database

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Open the Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Copy all of [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql) into the editor.
4. Run the SQL.

The schema creates the tables, indexes, triggers, functions, and Row Level
Security policies used by the app.

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Connect a Solana wallet. The app will ask you to sign a message so it can create
or verify your IDL Sentinel user session.

### 5. Make Yourself an Admin

After your first wallet sign-in creates a row in `users`, run this in the
Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET is_admin = true
WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS';
```

Refresh the app after updating the row. Admin users can add, edit, hide, and
delete monitored programs without paying the activation fee.

### 6. Add Your First Program

As an admin:

1. Go to Programs.
2. Click Add Program.
3. Paste a Solana program ID.
4. Save the program.

As a regular user:

1. Go to Programs.
2. Click Add Program.
3. Preview the program IDL.
4. If it is already monitored, add it to your watchlist for free.
5. If it is new, approve the one-time USDC activation payment.

New programs are added to the shared registry. Once a program is in the registry,
any user can watch it for free.

## Monitoring Cron

The monitor endpoint is:

```text
GET /api/cron/monitor-idls
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

For local testing:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/monitor-idls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

The repo includes [vercel.json](vercel.json), which schedules the endpoint every
15 minutes on Vercel. If you deploy somewhere else, configure a scheduler that
calls the same endpoint with the Authorization header.

Each run:

- fetches active program IDLs,
- creates new snapshots when IDLs change,
- records detected changes,
- sends pending Slack and Telegram notifications,
- cleans up expired Telegram connection tokens.

## Notifications

Notifications are watchlist-based. A user receives an alert only when:

1. they are signed in,
2. the program is in their watchlist,
3. the notification channel is configured,
4. the monitoring cron detects a new change for that program.

### Slack

Each user configures Slack from Settings by pasting an incoming webhook URL. The
app accepts webhook URLs beginning with `https://hooks.slack.com/` and includes a
test button.

### Telegram

1. Create a Telegram bot with BotFather.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
3. Register the webhook:

   ```bash
   curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
     -d "url=$NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL/api/telegram/webhook"
   ```

4. In IDL Sentinel, go to Settings and click Connect Telegram.
5. Open the generated Telegram link and press Start.

Telegram connection links expire after 10 minutes.

## User Roles

### Admins

- Add programs directly without payment.
- Edit program names and descriptions.
- Hide inactive programs from regular users.
- Delete programs.
- View all programs, including inactive ones.

### Regular Users

- View active monitored programs.
- Add or remove programs from their watchlist.
- Configure Slack and Telegram notifications.
- Add a new shared program through the USDC activation flow.
- Edit or delete programs they activated.

## Change Severity

IDL Sentinel assigns a severity to each detected change:

| Severity   | Examples                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `critical` | Instruction removed, signer requirement changed, IDL removed |
| `high`     | Account/type removed, writable account requirement changed   |
| `medium`   | Existing instruction/type/account/error modified             |
| `low`      | New instruction, account, type, or error added               |

## Useful Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm start
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm format:check
```

## Project Structure

```text
src/app/api/cron/monitor-idls/  Monitoring cron endpoint
src/lib/solana/idl-fetcher.ts   On-chain IDL discovery and parsing
src/lib/monitoring/             Snapshot comparison and change detection
src/lib/notifications/          Slack and Telegram delivery
src/lib/auth/                   Wallet signature auth and JWT sessions
src/lib/db/                     Supabase data access helpers
supabase/schema.sql             Database source of truth
```

## Troubleshooting

### The app starts but shows no data

Make sure the Supabase schema has been applied and `.env.local` points at the
same Supabase project.

### Wallet sign-in fails

Check `JWT_SECRET`, browser wallet support for message signing, and the
Supabase keys. The app creates the user during wallet verification.

### A program cannot be activated

Confirm the program has a public on-chain IDL. IDL Sentinel checks Anchor legacy
IDL accounts and Solana Program Metadata IDL entries.

### The cron endpoint returns 401

The request must include:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

### No notifications are sent

Check that the program is in the user's watchlist, the user configured Slack or
Telegram, the cron endpoint is running, and there is at least one pending change
for that watched program.

### Payment activation fails

Confirm `PAYMENT_TREASURY_USDC_ACCOUNT` is a valid USDC token account, the payer
has a USDC token account with enough balance, and both client and server RPC URLs
point to the intended Solana network.
